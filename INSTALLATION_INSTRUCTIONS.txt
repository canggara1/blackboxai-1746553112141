This guide will help you set up and run the POS (Point of Sale) application on your local machine.

Prerequisites:
--------------

   - Download and install from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
3. Internet connection to download dependencies

Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
-------------------------------------
- Obtain the project files and place them in a folder on your computer.

Step 2: Setup Backend
---------------------
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```
3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with the following variables:
   ```
   MIDTRANS_CLIENT_ID=your_midtrans_client_id
   MIDTRANS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_midtrans_client_secret
   MIDTRANS_PARTNER_ID=your_midtrans_partner_id
   MIDTRANS_MERCHANT_ID=your_midtrans_merchant_id
   MIDTRANS_CHANNEL_ID=12345
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/posapp
   PORT=5000
   ```
   Replace the values with your actual Midtrans credentials and MongoDB connection string.
5. Start the backend server:

   node server.js
   ```
   The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:5000

Troubleshooting:
